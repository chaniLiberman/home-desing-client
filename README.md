Description
On this website you can see a variety of products, filter by categories and add to your favorites products you like or add to the cart products you are interested in purchasing. A checkout page is still under construction, so it is not possible to switch to a payment page at this stage (it is not part of the project requirements..) By clicking on a product you can see the extended details and add to the cart. If you log in as an admin user, you can add / edit / delete products
in certain components such as the register, I exceeded the limit of 200 lines because of the multiple content in this component and not because of the way the code was written..
